# Privacy Policy for ReelCounter

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

ReelCounter ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.

## Our Privacy-First Commitment

ReelCounter is designed with privacy as the core principle. We believe your data belongs to you and should never leave your device.

## Information We Collect

### We Collect NO Information

ReelCounter does **NOT** collect, transmit, or store any personal information. Specifically:

- ❌ **No Personal Data**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information
- ❌ **No Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the app
- ❌ **No Device Information**: We do not collect device IDs, location data, or device specifications
- ❌ **No Instagram Data**: We do not access, store, or transmit any Instagram content, messages, or account information
- ❌ **No Network Activity**: The app has no internet permission and cannot send data anywhere

### What We Store Locally

The only data stored by ReelCounter is:

- **Reel Count Data**: Daily counts of Instagram Reels you've viewed
- **Storage Location**: All data is stored locally on your device using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences
- **Encryption**: All stored data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- **No Cloud Sync**: Data never leaves your device

## How We Use Information

Since we collect no information, there is nothing to use, share, or sell.

The locally stored reel count data is used solely to:

- Display your daily reel count
- Calculate weekly totals and averages
- Show your 7-day usage history

This data is processed entirely on your device and never transmitted anywhere.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

- All data is stored on your device using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences
- Data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption
- No data is stored on external servers or cloud services
- No backups are created outside your device

### Data Deletion

You can delete all data at any time by:

- Using the "Reset All Data" button in the app
- Uninstalling the app (which removes all stored data)

## Permissions

### Accessibility Service Permission

ReelCounter requires Accessibility Service permission to function. This permission is used **exclusively** for:

- Detecting scroll events in the Instagram app
- Identifying when you view Instagram Reels
- Counting reel views for digital wellbeing awareness

**What we do NOT do with this permission:**

- ❌ We do not read your messages, posts, or any Instagram content
- ❌ We do not interact with Instagram on your behalf
- ❌ We do not capture screenshots or record your screen
- ❌ We do not access any other apps or services
- ❌ We do not transmit any accessibility data

The accessibility service only monitors scroll events from Instagram and uses heuristic detection to identify Reel views. No content is read, stored, or transmitted.

### No Internet Permission

ReelCounter explicitly **removes** internet permission from the app. This means:

- The app cannot access the internet
- The app cannot send data to any server
- The app cannot receive data from any server
- The app cannot use network APIs

This is a core privacy feature of the app.

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT share your data with anyone.**

- ❌ No third-party services
- ❌ No analytics providers
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No data brokers
- ❌ No government agencies (unless required by law, but we have no data to provide)

Since we collect no data and store everything locally, there is nothing to share.

## Children's Privacy

ReelCounter does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we collect no information at all, this is not applicable. However, if you are under 13, please get parental permission before using the app.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: View your data anytime in the app
- **Delete**: Delete all data using the "Reset All Data" button
- **Control**: Uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Transparency**: Review this privacy policy and our open-source code

## Third-Party Services

ReelCounter does not use any third-party services, SDKs, or libraries that collect data. The app uses only:

- Android system libraries
- Jetpack Compose (UI framework)
- EncryptedSharedPreferences (local encrypted storage)
- WorkManager (for scheduled tasks)

None of these transmit data outside your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app repository

Since the app has no internet access, policy updates will be reflected in new app versions.
