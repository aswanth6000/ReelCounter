## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Requirements

- **Android Version**: Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- **Instagram App**: Must have Instagram installed
- **Accessibility Permission**: Required for Reel detection

### Architecture

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM-inspired
- **Storage**: EncryptedSharedPreferences
- **Background Tasks**: WorkManager

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: The app uses Android's AccessibilityService to monitor scroll events
2. **Filtering**: Only processes events from Instagram (`com.instagram.android`)
3. **Heuristics**: Uses UI tree inspection to identify Reels vs Feed/Explore
4. **Counting**: Increments count when a Reel scroll is detected (with cooldown to prevent double-counting)
5. **Storage**: Saves counts by date in encrypted local storage

### Detection Logic

The app uses heuristic-based detection to identify Reel scrolls:

- Checks for "Reels" text in UI tree
- Looks for Reel-specific UI elements (Like, Comment, Share buttons)
- Identifies full-screen vertical video layouts
- Uses scroll delta thresholds to filter significant scrolls

**Note**: Detection is heuristic-based and may not be 100% accurate. Instagram's UI changes frequently, so the app uses multiple indicators to improve accuracy.
